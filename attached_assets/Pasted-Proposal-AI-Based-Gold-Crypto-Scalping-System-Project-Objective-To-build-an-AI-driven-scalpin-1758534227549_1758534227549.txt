Proposal: AI-Based Gold & Crypto Scalping System
🎯 Project Objective

To build an AI-driven scalping dashboard that provides high-confidence, real-time Buy/Sell signals on Gold and Top 20 Cryptocurrencies using technical indicators, AutoML models, and fundamental data sources — optimized for fast-paced traders and scalpers.

✅ Key Features Overview
Feature	Description
Markets Supported	Gold (XAUUSD) + Top 20 Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
Timeframes	5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 1d
Signal Generation	AutoML/LSTM Model per asset, high-probability directional predictions
SL/TP Calculation	ATR-based Stop Loss and 2×ATR Take Profit (1:2 Risk-Reward Ratio)
Technical Indicators	EMA20, EMA50, RSI(14), MACD, VWAP, ATR
Fundamentals	DXY chart (Gold), BTC Dominance (Crypto), News Feeds
Auto Refresh	Automatically updates based on timeframe – only after candle closes
Streamlit Dashboard	User-friendly, live chart with overlays, signal panel, and news integration
🧠 System Workflow (How It Works End-to-End)
1️⃣ User Input Panel (Sidebar)

Market Type: Gold or Crypto

Asset Selector: XAUUSD for Gold, or select from Top 20 coins for Crypto

Timeframe Selector: 5m to 1d

Auto-Refresh: Automatically refreshes dashboard after each complete candle

2️⃣ Data Fetching

Gold Price Data: Fetched from Yahoo Finance (XAUUSD=X)

Crypto Data: Fetched from Yahoo Finance (e.g. BTC-USD, ETH-USD)

Dollar Index (DXY): For inverse correlation with Gold

News Scraping:

Gold: ForexFactory (high-impact events)

Crypto: CryptoNews / CoinDesk headlines

🔒 Only fully completed candles are used (prevents repainting)

3️⃣ Technical Indicators (Model Features)

Trend Indicators: EMA20, EMA50

Volatility/SL: ATR(14)

Momentum: MACD

Volume: VWAP (for crypto)

Overbought/Oversold: RSI(14)

📊 Indicators are both plotted and used as input features for the ML model.

4️⃣ Machine Learning (AutoML / LSTM Inference)

Each asset has its own pre-trained model stored as: /models/{asset}.pkl

Prediction made on next candle direction

1 = Bullish (BUY), 0 = Bearish (SELL)

Confidence threshold:

70% Bullish → BUY Signal

70% Bearish → SELL Signal

Otherwise → NO TRADE

5️⃣ Signal Calculation

Entry: Last Close

Stop Loss: ±1×ATR from Entry (below for Buy, above for Sell)

Take Profit: ±2×ATR from Entry (target 1:2 RR)

Displayed clearly on dashboard

6️⃣ Chart Display

Plotly Candlestick Chart with interactive zoom, hover, and pan

Overlay Indicators: EMA20, EMA50, RSI, MACD, VWAP

Clean and professional look for visual confirmation

7️⃣ Fundamentals Panel

Gold

Dollar Index (DXY) Line Chart

Top 5 High-Impact Economic Events from ForexFactory

Crypto

(Optional) BTC Dominance Chart

Top 5 Latest Crypto News Headlines

8️⃣ Auto-Refresh Logic

Refresh is dynamically set based on selected timeframe:

5m → refresh every 5 minutes

15m → refresh every 15 minutes

Refreshes only after candle is complete to ensure accuracy

9️⃣ User Dashboard Layout
Section	Description
Sidebar Panel	Asset selection, timeframe selector, and auto-refresh note
Main Panel	Candlestick chart with overlays
Signal Box	Clear Buy/Sell/No Trade signal with entry, SL, TP, and confidence level
Fundamentals	DXY chart + Forex news (Gold) OR BTC dominance + crypto news (Crypto)

🧭 Designed for clarity and speed – critical for scalpers.

✅ Model Training Script (model_train.py)

✅ Real-Time Dashboard with Signals

✅ Documentation + Setup Instructions

✅ Modular, Extensible Codebase

📌 Visual Mockup

Would you like me to generate a visual mockup (image) showing the dashboard layout, sections, and signal panel as described?
It can make this proposal even easier to present to a client or developer.

Let me know if you want the dashboard mockup, or if you'd like help setting up model retraining / backtesting / Binance integration.
